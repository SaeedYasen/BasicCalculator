🚀 Excited to share my latest C++ project: A Basic Calculator! 💻

This project allows users to perform basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division intuitively. Users can input equations directly (e.g., `5+7`, `8/4`), and the program will instantly process and display the results. 🧮

Key features:
✅ Supports direct equation input (e.g., `5+7`, `12-3`) for quick calculations.  
✅ Error handling for invalid operators and division by zero.  
✅ Clear and user-friendly prompts for a seamless experience.  

What I learned through this project:
🔹 Input parsing and handling in C++ using `stringstream`.  
🔹 Efficient use of control structures like loops and switch statements.  
🔹 Writing clean and maintainable code with a focus on user experience.
