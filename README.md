🚀 Excited to share an updated version of my C++ project: A Basic Calculator! 💻



In this version, I've enhanced the user experience by allowing users to input equations directly (e.g., `5+7`) instead of entering numbers and operators separately. This feature simplifies interaction and mimics real-world calculator functionality. 🧮



Key features:

✅ Direct equation input (e.g., `8/4`, `3*9`) for quicker calculations.

✅ Error handling for invalid operators and division by zero.

✅ Clear, user-friendly prompts.



This project helped me deepen my understanding of:

🔹 Input parsing and handling in C++ using `stringstream`.

🔹 Using control structures like loops and switch statements.

🔹 Writing cleaner and more user-friendly code.
